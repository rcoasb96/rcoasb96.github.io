        <h2>Hey there!</h2>
          <p>Here is a page where you can find out more about my background. I have included some 
            pictures and videos, enjoy!</p>

          <h2>Where it all began...</h2>
            <p>I was born in Coacoatzintla, a small "pueblo" in Veracruz, Mexico on the 23rd of December.
              I don't remember much of my life there since I came to the United States when I turned 3.
              What I do remeber, however, is that my grandparents had a huge tree next to their house.
              I also remeber my grandfather building a swing in that tree, just for me! When I turned
              a year old, my parents decided to come to the States to have more work and provide me 
              a better life. However, they had to leave me behind with my grandparents because there 
              were a lot of risks involved if I tagged along. I stayed with my grandparents a little
              after my third birthday. Then my mom had had enough of the distance and sent my dad back 
              to Mexico to get me and bring me to the United States.</p>

          <h2>Life in the States</h2>
            <p>Once I arrived in the States, I met my new baby brother Erik. Again, since I was
              young, I don't really remember much of when I arrived. However, my mom always tells 
              me stories about how I wanted everything and how I wnated to see everyone. At the time 
              of my arrival, my parent had bought a new house -- which is the one we stil live in today. 
              I had to share a room with my brother since there were some uncles and aunts that were 
              also living with us. Life went on pretty smoothly after that, I went to school with my 
              brother, we had lots of family events, we traveled, and by 2006 I had another little 
              little brother, Edwin. After Edwin was born, everything was practically the same. Still
              went to the same school, except Edwin was also going now, and around 2009 I finally
              had my own room. I was very happy about that, but Erik not as much since he now had to
              share with Edwin --and he still does to this day.</p>

          <h2>My life today</h2>
            <p>Nothing has really changed from that. We still live in the same house, Edwin 
              is still in the same school, Erik goes to Curie High School, and I go to college at 
              Illinois Tech. My parents work full time --my mom works two jobs-- and I am in the 
              process of applying for a job as well. Being the oldest of three has tought me a lot
              about setting examples for my brothers as well as learn how to be responsible. I am 
              helping Erik with picking out colleges and majors that he's concidering and I am helping 
              Edwin with his elementary schoolwork. I am very grateful that my parents had the opporunity
              to bring me to the United States and allow me to have the opportunities that I have.</p>
